    <h3>CYCLE Overview</h3>
    <p>There is an increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals worldwide, 
    however, in Asia Pacific the largest regional workforce gap of 1.42  million professionals exists. 
    There are many challenges related to cybersecurity in Asia, 
    as identified, such as the risks of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
    As the technology processes and the market needs evolve and differ, the necessary skills 
    are changing and require up-skilling or re-skilling. Two most affected groups are (i) Cybersecurity 
    related programme students lacking practical industry experience and understanding, and (ii) Experienced professionals 
    whose skills are outdated or insufficient for the current cybersecurity industry.</p>

    <p>The aim of CYCLE project is to provide a reasonable and realistic solution enabling a strong 
    cooperation between academia and industry on Cybersecurity & AI programmes via knowledge transfer and 
    innovation; to develop new curricula that are (a) innovative with design thinking methodology and (b) 
    interconnected with the evolving threat landscape and the changing needs of the workforce and the cybersecurity 
    market; to establish a regional innovation, knowledge sharing and networking hub in Asia to foster excellent regional 
    cybersecurity industry development. </p>

    <p>Totally more than 280 cybersecurity professionals, academics, administrative staff and students, 
    will directly benefit from this Project in Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, while more than 400 contacts/stakeholders 
    will be reached during the project implementation. The following outputs will be produced: 6 new MSc, 6 new labs, 3 
    training programmes for professionals, 1 e-learning platform, a web based platform serving as hub for knowledge transfer 
    and innovation, 6 career days ,conference and outputs related to project promotion. CYCLE enables the participating Asian 
    HEIs to become catalysts of economic and social development and produce the next highly-qualified workforce that can drive 
    the economic success.</p>
